        <p><b>Maintain <u>at least</u> a 1-metre distance between yourself and others</b> to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak.
                Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better.</p>
        <p>Avoid any or all of the following 3 C's:</p>

    Wearing a Mask

        <div class="card card-body">
        <p><b>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. </b> The appropriate use, storage and cleaning
        or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible. Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy
        of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Here's how to wear a mask in a hygenic manner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.</li>
            <li>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
            <li>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</li>
            <li>Don’t use masks with valves.</li>

    Practise Good Hygiene

        <ul>
            <li><u>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands</u> with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
            <li><u>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</u> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.</li>
            <li><u>Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.</u> Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19.</li>
            <li><u>Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently</u> especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.</li>
